* 7 Days Of Code Challenge
  * The challenge proposes to follow simple guidelines given over the course of 7 days to create a Front-End App. 
  
* The main focus of this project was to practice how to:
  * Use mobile-first architecture
  * Create responsive layouts
  
- Schedule
  - Day 1: Create and style header and appointments sections
  - Day 2: Create and style footer and floating button
  - Day 3: Use relative units to style the font and adjust cards width
  - Day 4: Create media query to adjust the layout for tablets and desktop
  - Day 5: Modify the footer to be a side menu on larger layouts
  - Day 6: On larger layouts, change the floating button to a form
  - Day 7: Publish the page
  
  - Observations:
  - The focus of the exercise was using CSS, therefore I preferred to make the side menu with css instead of javascript. 
    - I used this [blog](http://lucasmaiaesilva.com.br/posts/criando-modal-simples-com-html-e-css/) for reference to create the modal menu
